## APT attacks
An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack refers to a prolonged, targeted cyber attack that is carried out by a sophisticated adversary with specific objectives. **APT attacks typically involve a combination of various techniques and tools to gain unauthorized access, maintain persistence, and exfiltrate sensitive data over an extended period of time.**
Persistence: APT attacks are typically long-term and persistent in nature, with the attacker attempting to maintain their presence within the target network or system over an extended period of time.
Advanced Techniques: APT attacks often involve advanced techniques and tools, including zero-day exploits, custom malware, social engineering, and targeted phishing emails. Attackers may leverage sophisticated tactics to evade detection and bypass security measures.
Covert Operations: APT attackers aim to remain undetected by blending into the normal network activity, using techniques such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, and encryption to hide their actions.
