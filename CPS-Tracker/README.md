# CPS-Tracker

## Fear and logging
At first they asked a few questions which are in section IV. Provthings,
Completeness: The system should ans “How was the data generated by my sleep sensor used?” and “What triggered my front door to unlock?”
Applicability: To satisfy applicability, the framework should be adaptable with modest changes to the broad variety of IoT platforms listed in Table I.
Minimality: To achieve minimality, it should require few or no changes to the semantics of the IoT platform, or to the platform itself

All of those 3 points are also satisfied with the testbed system.

In the implementation - section V, what they didn't consider is following,
As shown in Algorithm 1, code that was not on any control-
flow path from the entry points to the sinks was not instru-
mented as it did not affect the behavior of sinks. However, in
the case of SmartApps we did identify two exceptions. One
exception was dynamic method invocation. Since a dynamic
method invocation could invoke any method in the SmartApp
at runtime, we instrumented code to track this call. We further
discuss the implication of it in §VIII. The other exception
was assignment to global variables as they are shared among
executions. If a global variable has been assigned data that
could be derived from sources and the variable has been used
by sinks, the code in the control-flow path from entry points
to the assignment statement also needs to be instrumented to
track the provenance of the data.


Acoording to the above text and the Fig. 8, they instrumented only function calls with argument name and argument value and the global variables. They didn't consider the conditions. As they say,
Figure 8 shows some of the helper
functions: entryMethod , trackVarAssign and trackSink ,
which track provenance of program entry point invocation,
variable assignment and sink invocation respectively.

I am not sure if we did the trackVarAssign and trackSink. With my minimal knowledge, I think the trackVarAssign means if the parameter is passed to the function and that's changed which is triggering an event and the trackSink can be the caller of the function. If that's the case, then we did it.

For the motivation, as we discussed if we log only the function calls and the global variables then we can't see the attack. But I think still it's possible to identify the attack because in our model we are generating the table and the events with the function calls and from global variables. I am not sure how to make a good motivation in the paper.

## APT attacks
An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack refers to a prolonged, targeted cyber attack that is carried out by a sophisticated adversary with specific objectives. **APT attacks typically involve a combination of various techniques and tools to gain unauthorized access, maintain persistence, and exfiltrate sensitive data over an extended period of time.**
Persistence: APT attacks are typically long-term and persistent in nature, with the attacker attempting to maintain their presence within the target network or system over an extended period of time.
Advanced Techniques: APT attacks often involve advanced techniques and tools, including zero-day exploits, custom malware, social engineering, and targeted phishing emails. Attackers may leverage sophisticated tactics to evade detection and bypass security measures.
Covert Operations: APT attackers aim to remain undetected by blending into the normal network activity, using techniques such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, and encryption to hide their actions.

## False Data Injection:

In False Data Injection (FDI) an adversary maliciously injects fabricated or manipulated data into a system or network. Purpose of this attack is to deceive or manipulate the behavior of the targeted system, leading to incorrect decisions, compromised operations, or compromised integrity of the data.
**This could involve modifying sensor readings, altering data packets, or manipulating the input signals to deceive the system.**

[In testbed, it starts with this check](https://github.com/fischertechnik/txt_training_factory/blob/master/TxtSmartFactoryLib/src/TxtVacuumGripperRobotRun.cpp#L192-L195),
```
		else if (!dps.is_DIN())
		//else if(!block)
		{
			FSM_TRANSITION( START_DELIVERY, color=blue, label='dsi' );
		}
```
This `dps.is_DIN()` function is defined in the `TxtDeliveryPickupStation.cpp` [file](https://github.com/fischertechnik/txt_training_factory/blob/master/TxtSmartFactoryLib/src/TxtDeliveryPickupStation.cpp#L117-L129), 
```
	bool TxtDeliveryPickupStation::is_DIN()
	{
		std::cout<<"Function: TxtDeliveryPickupStation::is_DIN()\n";
		SPDLOG_LOGGER_TRACE(spdlog::get("console"), "is_DIN", 0);
		assert(pT->pTArea);
		return (pT->pTArea->ftX1in.uni[6] == 1);
	}
```

**[Note:Most important thing to notice here this function `is_DIN()` will return `false or 0`. But the condition will check if it's not `true or 1`. So, if I print the values then I should get `0`. That's what I got in the log.]** See the following,

**False Data Injection: To perform this attack, we will insert malicious data inside the code. Which will trigger [this particular code](https://github.com/fischertechnik/txt_training_factory/blob/master/TxtSmartFactoryLib/src/TxtVacuumGripperRobotRun.cpp#L194) or, we will directly [call this case](https://github.com/fischertechnik/txt_training_factory/blob/master/TxtSmartFactoryLib/src/TxtVacuumGripperRobotRun.cpp#L350),**
```
	FSM_TRANSITION( START_DELIVERY, color=blue, label='dsi' );
```
Or,
```
	case START_DELIVERY:
	{
		printState(START_DELIVERY);

		setTarget("hbw");
		moveDeliveryInAndGrip();
		moveNFC();
		std::string uid = dps.nfcReadUID();
		if (uid.empty())
		{
			FSM_TRANSITION( WRONG_COLOR, color=red, label='empty tag' );
			break;
		} else {
			proStorage.resetTagUidMaskTs(uid);
			proStorage.setTimestampNow(uid, DELIVERY_RAW_INDEX);
			if (reqWP_HBW != 0) {
				reqWP_HBW->printDebug();
				delete reqWP_HBW;
			}
			reqWP_HBW = new TxtWorkpiece(uid,WP_TYPE_NONE,WP_STATE_RAW);
			reqWP_HBW->printDebug();
			FSM_TRANSITION( COLOR_DETECTION, color=blue, label='nfc tag ok' );
		}
#ifdef __DOCFSM__
		FSM_TRANSITION( START_DELIVERY, color=blue, label='wait' );
#endif
		break;
	}
```


**If we do that then we will not see the Function call, so according to that we or, the administrator can tell that's an attack.** 
```

```

**To replace the sensor data:**
Write script to intercept the data stream, modify the sensor data, and send the altered data to the system using python.
Intercept the MQTT messages passing through the middleware and modify the relevant data fields before forwarding them to the system. I can use wireshark/python for this.
