Make sure that the implementation is well written.
 - show the functions arguments and values were collected.

## Writing paper guidelines
1. At first, work on the Motivation part,
    
    In the motivation, I have prepared a few graphs, which will show the solution to the problem of Hbw storage. It's stateful.
    Both overflow and underflow are shown in the graph. Also, it visualizes the vgr and hbw communication.

3. Then Design and implementation.

1. Write the introduction first
2. Then motivation
3. Design - what we need and why we need. Little bit of exp
4. implementation - Explanation of software/product in more detail.
5.
