Solution:
curl -I HEAD -i http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php


What is Curl?
curl	- is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the
		supported protocols
	-I, --head
		(HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only!
	-i, --include
              Include  the  HTTP  response  headers  in  the  output. The HTTP
              response headers can include things like server  name,  cookies,
              date of the document, HTTP version and more...

              To  view the request headers, consider the -v, --verbose option.
	-v, --verbose
              Makes curl verbose during the operation.  Useful  for  debugging
              and  seeing  what's  going  on "under the hood". A line starting
              with '>' means "header data" sent by  curl,  '<'  means  "header
              data"  received  by  curl  that is hidden in normal cases, and a
              line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

              If you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might
              be the option you're looking for.

              If  you think this option still doesn't give you enough details,
              consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.
