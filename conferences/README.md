```
Greetings.

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Raihan, I am doing my Ph.D. in computer science at The University of Utah. I am writing to inquire about your current research and publication projects. I am interested in offering my assistance with any upcoming paper reviews that you may have. I would be honored to review papers on behalf of your review team and provide constructive feedback. 

If you have any papers or manuscripts that require review, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am confident that I can provide valuable insights and feedback to help improve the quality of the publication. It would be great if you could provide me with approximately one month to review and provide feedback for each paper. This would greatly help me to improve my knowledge and keep-me updated with the most recent researchs going on in this broad field. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you. 

 

Best regards,
Md Raihan Ahmed
